This is a simple implementation of a [JokuWiki](https://github.com/symcbean/jokuwiki) plugin.

The code adds Javascript and CSS to render callouts on the page as speech bubbles.

This requires Dokuwiki with the Jokuwiki plugin to run. The Jokuwiki plugin
is available from the same site where you got this code.
